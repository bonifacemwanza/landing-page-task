## Task Description

Task: Given the image above, please implement HTML with CSS to match the description.
1. You will have 3 containers to add to a simple HTML page:
a. Header that will be always at the top of page
b. Content that will fill up the height of the page between header and footer
c. Footer that will be aligned to the bottom, and it should contain image content inside.
Assumptions:
1. Add simple HTML document with CSS rules to cover layout functionality
2. For the image content, how you deliver the image is up to you
3. For the text content, use any text - lorem ipsum is always a win :)
4. You can use any image link you like (e.g. https://picsum.photos )
5. The expected delivery is HTML with CSS document, but if this is easier for you - you can
use any build tool you like (e.g. https://parceljs.org/ )
Expected deliverables:
1. Source code / pasted in the doc or in a zip file or private repository to share (you can either
pack the whole library/framework project or only files you modified from the initial project
repository). The source code should have the logic that resolves the task.
